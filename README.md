🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction
📌 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts house prices based on features like location, number of bedrooms, and square footage.
The model is trained using regression algorithms and exposed via a Flask REST API.

⚡ Goal: Help users and businesses estimate property prices quickly and accurately.

🚀 Features

Predict house prices given user inputs (location, size, BHK).
REST API built with Flask for easy integration.
Preprocessed dataset with categorical encoding and feature scaling.
Trained regression models and selected the best based on RMSE.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
Flask (API backend)
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (basic frontend for demo)
Database (optional): SQLite / MySQL (for location data)

📊 Results

Trained and tested on housing dataset.
Achieved good prediction accuracy (low RMSE).
Supports location-specific predictions.
